Mt. Bachelor Snowpack & Forecast Viewer

A Python-based tool that visualizes current snowpack levels (SWE and Snow Depth) against historical climatology and appends multi-model weather forecasts (including AI models) to the current trend.

🎯 Overview

This tool fetches real-time telemetry data from USDA SNOTEL sites and combines it with weather forecasts from Open-Meteo to create a "single pane of glass" view of the ski season. It answers the questions: "How does this year compare to the past?" and "How much snow is coming in the next 10-16 days?"

The output is a self-contained, interactive HTML file generated by Plotly.

✨ Key Features

Historical Context: Fetches 20+ years of daily data (SWE & Depth) to calculate statistical bands (Median, 10th-90th percentiles, Min/Max).

Multi-Model Forecasts: Integrates data from standard physics models (GFS, ECMWF, ICON, GEM) and experimental AI models (ECMWF AIFS, GraphCast).

AI Model Support: Includes custom logic to derive snowfall from AI models that lack explicit snow physics variables.

Interactive Visualization:

Toggle between SWE (Snow Water Equivalent) and Snow Depth.

Highlight specific historical years to compare trends.

Hover over data points for precise values.

Water Year Logic: Automatically standardizes all data to "Water Years" (Oct 1st start) for accurate seasonal comparison.

⚙️ Methodology

1. Data Sources

SNOTEL: Telemetry data is fetched directly from the USDA NRCS Report Generator.

Sites used: Dutchman Flat, Three Creek Meadow, etc. (Configurable).

Forecasts: Weather data is fetched via the Open-Meteo API.

2. Forecast Logic (The "Smart Calc")

Forecasting snow depth is complex, especially with experimental AI models that often output raw precipitation and temperature but not calculated "snow depth." This tool uses a tiered approach:

Method 1: Explicit Snowfall (Standard Models)

Used for GFS, ICON, ECMWF Hi-Res.

Directly requests the snowfall_sum variable from the model physics.

Method 2: Daily Aggregates (AI Models)

Used for ECMWF AIFS and Google GraphCast.

These models often lack hourly snow physics. The tool calculates snow by analyzing Daily Precipitation Sums vs. Daily Mean Temperature.

Logic: If Mean Temp ≤ 2.0°C (35.6°F), Precipitation is converted to Snow (10:1 ratio).

Method 3: Hourly Smart Calc (Fallback)

If daily data fails, it falls back to analyzing hourly precipitation and temperature windows.

Logic: If Hourly Temp ≤ 2.5°C (36.5°F), Precipitation is treated as Snow.

3. Elevation Correction

The script explicitly requests forecast data for 1950m (~6400ft). This forces the API to adjust temperatures using lapse rates, ensuring that the rain/snow line is calculated for the ski area elevation, not the generic grid elevation.

🚀 Usage

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Pip

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/snowpack-viewer.git](https://github.com/yourusername/snowpack-viewer.git)
cd snowpack-viewer


Install dependencies:

pip install pandas plotly requests numpy


Configuration

Open snow_tracker.py and modify the configuration block to target different SNOTEL sites or regions:

STATE = 'OR'
AREA = 'Mt. Hood Area' # Name for the chart title
LAT = 45.37  # Latitude for forecast
LON = -121.70 # Longitude for forecast
SITE_IDS = [123, 456] # SNOTEL Site IDs found on USDA map


Running the Tool

Run the script directly:

python snow_tracker.py


The script will output an HTML file to your Documents folder (or configured OUTPUT_DIR):
~/Documents/Snow/snotel_forecast_YYYYMMDD.html

📊 Output Example

The generated HTML file includes:

Shaded Bands: Represent statistical normals (Green = Normal, Blue = High, Red = Low).

Solid Line: The current season's data.

Dotted Lines: Forecast projections extending 10-16 days into the future.

Grid Menu: Buttons to highlight specific past seasons (e.g., "Compare to 2017").
